# Breast Cancer ML Web App

🔗 Live App:  
https://mlfirstwebappvishwajeet.netlify.app/

## About
This is my **first end-to-end Machine Learning web application** built completely from scratch.

I worked on everything for the first time:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and testing
- Saving and reusing the model
- Creating a backend using FastAPI
- Building a simple frontend
- Deploying the full application online

## What it does
The app takes a user input (combined score) and predicts whether the case is:
- Benign
- Malignant

⚠️ This project is for learning purposes only and not for real medical use.

## Tech Used
- Python, scikit-learn, Pandas
- FastAPI (Backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Render (Backend Deployment)
- Netlify (Frontend Deployment)

## Status
Working and deployed ✅

## Feedback
This is my first ML pipeline project.  
I’m open to suggestions and ideas for what I should build next.
